Obfuscation
===========

Here are a couple examples of ways to obfuscate some of the bash scripts.

base64
======

Base64 is a quick way to hide commands from being obviously malicious. It is also included in most linux distributions. If speed is an issue you can easily remove any unnecessary spaces in the bash scripts to reduce the size of the encoded command.

Example encode:

echo $COMMAND | base64

Example decode / execute:

echo $ENCODED | base64 -d - | sh

ROT13
=====

Rot13 is a simple rotation cipher only works with the A-Z and a-z. All other characters in the command will remain unchanged. There are a couple of ways to handle ROT13, the example uses tr which is included in most distributions. Remember that a rotation cipher like rot13 only has to be rerun through the tr command again to be decoded.

Example tr example:

echo $COMMAND | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'

ROT47
=====

Rot47 is an ASCII implementation of Rot13.

Example tr example:

echo $COMMAND |  | tr '\!-~' 'P-~\!-O'

ROTx8000
========

UTF-8 version of ROT.

Example python example:

python -c "exec(\"import sys\\ny = ''\\ns = sys.argv[1]\\nfor x in s: y += chr(ord(x) ^ 0x8000)\\nprint(y)\")" $COMMAND
